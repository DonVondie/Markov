Oh my God, how much time do you have? I'm going to get snooty because
if someone has to read this they might as well get a laugh. If you don't
get a laugh, you might go insane trying to tell yourself that "abbbaa"
is right and "abbbbbba" is not. I mean really! Is the goal here to confuse
people about the purpose of code? We take pretty writing and we chop it up?
:: angerrrrrr::

Not that anyone would listen to my suggestions anyway, but Markov chains
came about in PSYCHOLOGY for predicting behavior. They were a way of
analyzing chained behaviors and spontaneous recovery. 

IFFFFFF we are going to make the selling point of the assignment the teachable
moment of when to use maps and how much better they are than arraylists
for this kind of thing, then at least switch up what we are mapping!

It would be interesting to do this for student behavior on a given day
on campus. How often when I leave the physics building am I going to get
Twinnies? Morning routines? 

Even more interesting- chopping up states of Super Mario brothers. How
often do you go for the cheat on the first level? How often do you
go for coins vs. just getting through the end of the level.
How hard would that be since its an 8 bit game? Model all the series
of inputs from the controller? (The original NES didn't have that many buttons)

I'm rambling now aren't I? It's random you say? Ohhhhhh random like 
a Markov chain? I get it now.

With the aid of piazza, my man Efe Aras, and the universe's gentle hand
this is now done.
